# Assessment2019MachineLearning-Statistics
Etain's submission for Assessment 2019 module Machine Learning &amp; Statistics as part of the Higher Diploma in Data Analytics. Due: ~~November 29th, 2019~~ Friday December 13th, 2019.

Update: Ian has kindly given students an extension to the deadline for this project. The project will now be due any time on or before Friday December 13th.

## Module: Machine learning and statistics (52954)
## Lecturer: Dr Ian McLoughlin
## Student: Etain Upton G00318876
## Assessment 2019 - Due: ~~November 29th, 2019~~ Friday December 13th, 2019

Submission: The submission for this assessment must be in the form of a single GitHub repository.

This assessment concerns the well-known Boston House Prices dataset and the Python packages scipy, keras, and jupyter. The project is worth 100% of your marks for this module, but it is broken into three parts, as follows;
*	(20%) Describe: Create a git repository and make it available online for the lecturer to clone. The repository should contain all your work for this assessment. Within the repository, create a jupyter notebook that uses descriptive statistics and plots to describe the Boston House Prices dataset. This part is worth 20% of your overall mark.
*	(20%) Infer: To the above jupyter notebook, add a section where you use inferential statistics to analyse whether there is a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in median house prices between houses that are along the Charles river and those that aren’t. You should explain and discuss your ﬁndings within the notebook. This part is also worth 20%.
*	(60%) Predict: Again using the same notebook, use keras to create a neural network that can predict the median house price based on the other variables in the dataset. You are free to interpret this as you wish — for example, you may use all the other variables, or select a subset. This part is worth 60%.

The minimum standard for this assessment is a git repository containing a README ﬁle written in Markdown and a jupyter notebook containing your work. 
The README should contain a summary of your work and provide instructions as to how to run the jupyter notebook and the web application. 
A better project will be well laid out, clear and concise, and easily understood and run.

### Marking scheme; 
The following marking scheme will be used to mark the project out of 100%. Students should note, however, that in certain circumstances the examiner’s overall impression of the project may inﬂuence marks in each individual component.
*	20% Describe; 
Good summary of the dataset, repository well laid-out and organised. Reasonable commits to the repository. 
*	20% Infer;
Appropriate analysis of the relationship between the median house price and whether the house borders the river, with good explanations of the analysis. 
*	60% Predict; 
Well-trained neural network providing decent predictions of house prices based on the other variables. Good explanations of how to use the neural network and how it works.
